Mr. Bear's Cellar
Mr. Bear's Cellar is a creepypasta inspired writing forum that allows any user to enjoy reading scary stories about horror-related urban legends and folklore.

My Idea: 

The inspiration behind this application was my husband. One of his hobbies is to write and submit short stories to a writing forum and I thought it would be a great idea to make a space for him to do that! The "creepy, scary" aspect is for myself. I am in love with all things creepy, scary, horrorific so I thought the theme for right for me.

Styling:

Styling was done using Material-UI throughtout the application.  All the popup forms come from the material-ui library!

Code:

This application was done using Typescript, React's Class Components with Lifecyle methods, State Management, Routing and Guards, plus React-Router-Dom!

What you can do:

Users can go to the application and enjoy reading short stories and see cool photos without having to sign up or login. If they want to submit a short story, photo or leave a comment on a fellow user's story or photo they have to register and login. Enjoy!
